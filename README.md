## Key Features

- **Firebase Integration**: Store your pantry list securely in the cloud using Firebase's real-time database. Access your data from anywhere, ensuring that your pantry list is always up-to-date.
  
- **User Authentication**: Keep your data private and secure with Firebase authentication. Only you can access your pantry list by logging in with your account.

- **Pre-defined Recipes**: Access hard-coded recipes directly within the app. Find inspiration for your next meal using items you already have in your pantry.

## Future Plans

- **Community Forum**: A space for users to share and discover new recipes, tips, and tricks. Engage with a community of like-minded home cooks.

- **Nom Button**: Save your favorite recipes with a single click for easy access later.

- **Gourmet Guide Integration**: Plan your meals with AI-powered recipe suggestions and meal ideas based on your pantry's contents.

## Important Notice

I am currently using Firebase's free tier for storage and authentication. As this is a test deployment, the Firebase integration may expire soon unless we receive significant interest and support from users. If you find NomNomNet helpful, please let us know!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pantry-tracker.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd pantry-tracker

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install

4. **Setup Firebase:**
   Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.

    In your project settings, locate your Firebase configuration details, which should look like     this:
   ```bash
     const firebaseConfig = {
        apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
        authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
        projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
        storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
        messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
        appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
        measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
      };

5. **Make sure the .env.local file is ignored in .gitignore to avoid exposing sensitive information.**
   ```bash
   # .gitignore
   .env.local

6. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev

7. **Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.**
